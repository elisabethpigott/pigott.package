## Converting a species community dataframe to a matrix for further analysis

This will convert your species community dataframe and transform it into a matrix. You can then use this matrix to plug into community analysis functions. You must plug in a dataframe with only Species, Site_names, and Count as three seperate columns. The output will be a matrix of spread out species community data.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
bees <- read_csv("../inst/extdata/bee_fxndata.csv")
print(bees)
beematrix(bees, Species, Mo_since_burn_grouped, Count) 

```
